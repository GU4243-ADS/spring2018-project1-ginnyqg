# Project 1: Spooky Data Analysis
### Figs folder

The figs directory contains the figures. This directory only contains generated files; that is, one should always be able to delete the contents and regenerate them.

Figures shown in the master [`README.md`](https://github.com/GU4243-ADS/spring2018-project1-ginnyqg/blob/master/README.md) can be found here.
