# Project 1: Spooky Data Analysis

## Project Description
This is the first and only *individual* (as opposed to *team*) this semester. 

+ Projec title: Who wrote these spooky texts?

+ This project is conducted by Ginny Gao, Columbia UNI: qg2158

+ Project summary: This project studies writing styles from 3 popular horror authors (1800s to early 1900s): [Edgar Allan Poe (EAP)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Edgar_Allan_Poe), [HP Lovecraft (HPL)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/H._P._Lovecraft), and [Mary Wollstonecraft Shelley (MWS)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mary_Shelley). Compare and contrast positive and negative emotions in their writing content via sentiment analysis, and identify words frequently appear together in their excerpts through topic modeling.


## 1. Who write how many texts in the dataset?

Pie chart shows composition of author's texts in the dataset.

It appears that most texts belong to EAP (40.3%), followed by MWS (30.9%) and HPL (28.8%).


## 2. Do some authors use more questions in the texts than others?

Waffle chart presents the comparison of use of questions in texts among 3 authors.

Not suprisingly, EAP uses most number of questions in his texts, as EAP has more texts than others in the dataset. Notice MWS and HPL have approximately same number of texts in the dataset from study above (1), but MWS uses more than twice as many questions in her texts than HPL does. This can be a key identifier to differentiate MWS and HPL's texts.


## 3. What sentiments do you feel from these authors' writings?

Pyramid chart displays positive and negative emotional content comparison in authors' text.
